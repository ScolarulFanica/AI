My work for the Artificial Intelligence course, studied at Universite de Toulouse

This repository contains some of the laboratories of the Artificial Intelligence course as well as the final project.

The final project required to enhance a model that tries to predict the result of a football match (whether it is a win, draw or a loss) for a big dataset.
K-means is the method used for clustering with 3 clusters based on the nomalized and standardized data.
Try: Random Forest Method is used for classification of the data and to generate the confusion matrix.
Using XGB model and XGB regressor to train and predict data.

Final accuracy: 0.48
